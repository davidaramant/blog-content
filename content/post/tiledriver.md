* Deep Learning Basics
  * Continuous vs Discrete
  * Tensors
  * Show flow of data
  * Loss
  * Overfitting
  * Generative Models
* Data Normalization
  * Remove outside areas
* Data Augmentation
  * Rotations / mirroring
* Data Format
  * One-hot encoding
  * .NET vs Python (show sides here?)
    * numpy fast, python not
* Binary Classification
  * Show model summary
  * Concept of reshaping data
  * Tiledriver vs User Maps
  * Good results!
* Variational Autoencoders
  * What is an encoder?
    * BMP vs JPG
  * What is an autoencoder?
    * Show examples here (noise reduction)
  * What is a variational autoencoder?
    * Show examples here
  * show miserable, miserable results
    * Wolf 3D maps are not continous!!
* DCGANs
  * Generator vs Discriminator
  * Show cool examples
  * mention it is horribly hard to train
  * Show miserable results
  * Doom DCGAN
* RNN / LSTM
  * Concept
  * Show cool results
  * SLOW
  * Show miserable results
  * Potential with 2D context
* Conclusion
  * Generative Models will be super cool
    * Creating music
    * Creating scripts
    * Creating... movies?
  * Future Work
    * See if the GAN can be raised to the level of mediocrity
    * 2D RNN
